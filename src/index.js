Log of what Ive done this session:

Streamline the RenderAll function to ensure it only renders everything upon deletion and addition of projects, todos
Exported the Render all function
Streamlined the Setup.js file by creating a method for the inital Project which can be modified separately, ensuring setup calls it and only has methods absolutely necessary to be run once.
